in an arbitrary order:

 * set up a ticket tracker
 * implement nick changing
 * implement topic display and changing
 * implement per-channel name display
 * handle IRC color codes
 * implement screen redraw (ie C-l)
 * automatically resizable input area - gains/loses height as appropriate
   for current input buffer
 * history searching w/ C-s and C-r
 * slide out overlay widget for things like name listing
 * wm decorations for sizing and location
 * okay, fine: a window manager
